Unlike a classic unitary board of directors, this separation allowed for more direct control over decisions, but both bodies were initially composed almost exclusively of men, which represented a limitation in terms of diversity and inclusion."}]}

The TechNova management's approach represents the common fear that the directive is a mere imposition of quotas. 'Sofia Rossi's' approach, however, reflects the spirit of the directive: it is not about replacing merit, but about achieving it more authentically. Article 6, in fact, mandates selection based on objective criteria and gives priority to the underrepresented sex only 'with equal qualifications'. The argument, therefore, is that the directive forces companies to overcome traditional recruitment networks and unconscious biases, which often limit the search for the 'best talent' to a narrow pool of candidates. By implementing a transparent and objective selection process, the company does not weaken meritocracy, but strengthens it, discovering excellent talents (like 'Anja Sharma' or 'Sara Mancini' in the story) who would otherwise have remained invisible."}]}

The improvement in reputation and the increased attractiveness for talent are not side effects but the consequence of 'improved corporate governance', one of the key objectives of the directive.

As in the TechNova case, when a company makes its evaluation criteria public and opens applications globally, it is forced to define what 'merit' means.

Taking a biotechnology company like EcoVera as an example, the principle of 'transparent selection' from Article 6 translates from the legal to the operational level through the definition of clear, predetermined, and non-discriminatory selection criteria. In practice, this means that the company must: 1. **Define and Publish Criteria in Advance:** Before starting the search, the company must establish and make known the objective requirements. For a biotech company, these could be: specific skills in genomics or pharmaceutical development, experience with regulatory bodies like the EMA, ability to manage complex R&D projects, and knowledge of international markets. 2. **Objective Comparative Assessment:** Every candidate, male or female, must be evaluated based on these same criteria. This ensures that the choice is based on merit and not on unconscious biases or networks of contacts. 3. **Document the Process:** The comparative assessment must be documented to justify the final choice and, if necessary, to respond to requests for information from an unsuccessful candidate. In this way, the specific case of 'EcoVera' becomes an illustration of how Article 6 strengthens meritocracy through transparency."}]}

Explain how."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, the directive can have a catalytic effect. The case of EuroCorp demonstrates this: even if the holding company in Ireland benefited from a suspension, the compliance obligations of its subsidiary in Italy (where the directive was fully applied) forced the group to implement transparent selection processes. This often leads multinationals to harmonize their internal policies upwards, adopting the most rigorous standards as group policy to ensure consistency and reduce risks, triggering an overall improvement."}]}

What are the main quantitative objectives it is violating according to Article 5?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"According to **Article 5**, a company like Optima Fin is violating the obligation to reach, by June 30, 2026, one of two objectives: either at least 40% of directors of the underrepresented sex among those without executive duties, or at least 33% of directors of the underrepresented sex among all directors (executive and non-executive). 11% is clearly below both thresholds."}]}

What is a company's procedural responsibility according to Article 6, in addition to merely reaching quotas?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The primary responsibility, according to **Article 6**, is not just to reach a number, but to adopt a fair selection process. A company must establish clear, neutral, and predetermined qualification criteria before the selection. The refusal to implement such procedures, even in the name of a supposed 'meritocracy,' constitutes a direct violation of the directive's procedural obligations, which aim to ensure that merit is evaluated in an objective and non-discriminatory manner."}]}

The priority for a candidate of the underrepresented sex applies only 'in case of equal qualifications', and only after a comparative evaluation based on objective and predetermined criteria. The directive, therefore, does not replace merit, but strengthens it by obliging companies to define what merit is in a transparent way and to eliminate biases that can hinder a true meritocratic selection."}]}

What types of 'effective, proportionate and dissuasive' sanctions does Article 8 of the directive provide for?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"**Article 8** requires Member States to provide for effective sanctions. In addition to fines, which must be proportionate to the severity and duration of the violation, sanctions can include a very incisive measure: the possibility for a court to declare void or annul the appointment of a director made in violation of the procedural obligations of **Article 6**. This creates a strong legal and reputational risk."}]}

The case shows that non-compliance, particularly the failure to adopt transparent selection processes (**Art. 6**), exposes companies to concrete sanctions (**Art. 8**), including fines and the annulment of appointments. Procedural compliance is just as important as meeting numerical objectives."}]}
